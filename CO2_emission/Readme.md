# Exploratory analysis and Data Visualization with R
CO2 emissions per capita refer to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by a country or region per person in a given year. It is a critical metric used to assess the environmental impact of a country's activities and its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. 

## About Dataset
 I downloaded the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koustavghosh149/co2-emission-around-the-world).  This Dataset consists CO2 emissions in metricton per capita of every country around the world. The datas are from 1990 to 2019. Coutries regions are included. Data was collected from world data bank. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC

## Task
Find wich are the countries and regions with more CO2 emissions and the tendenci over time

## Tools
R for Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.
For the data viz I did a stream graph (also sometimes called “Theme River”). It is like a stacked area chart, but oriented around a central (rather than base) line. 

## Insights
- The global mean emission has been from 4.38 in 1990 to 4.06 mt/capita in 2019
- There is a significative difference between the CO2 emissions among the world regions and countries.
- Industrialized countries have higher per capita emissions than less industrialized nations.
- When visualizing the top 3 countries with more CO2 emissions there is a tendency  of reduction of the emissions from 2000. [Top 3 countries](https://github.com/anabella-varela/Proyects_with_R/blob/main/CO2_emission/country_plot.pdf)

The tendency is not evident when analyzind the top 3 regions with more CO2 emissions.
